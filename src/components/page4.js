        <p>
        Thus the prototype of smart wheelchair is designed successfully. The motion of prototype is controlled using gesture movement, MEMS sensor and RF. Most modern- day technologies use sensors such as gyroscope, to take interactive input and in this project also we have tried to make the robot interactive and close to human. Though some difficulties aroused and many remodeling was needed and the chair had some limitations which we learned while building it, at last the Smart Wheel Chair created very close to the adapted design philosophy.
